        <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, fish), and sometimes, in addition, eggs and/or vegetables such as potatoes in certain regional varieties. Biryani is popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora. It is also prepared in other regions such as parts of Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.
